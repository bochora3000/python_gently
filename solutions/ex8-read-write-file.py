"""
You will write three functions for this exercise. First, write a write_to_file() function with two parameters for the filename of the file and the text to write into the file. Second, write an append_to_file() function, which is identical to write_to_file() except that the file opens in append mode instead of write mode. Finally, write a read_from_file() function with one parameter for the filename to open. This function returns the full text contents of the file as a string.

These Python instructions should generate the file and the assert statement checks that the content is correct:

write_to_file('greet.txt', 'Hello!\n')

append_to_file('greet.txt', 'Goodbye!\n')

assert read_from_file('greet.txt') == 'Hello!\nGoodbye!\n'

This code writes the text 'Hello!\n' and 'Goodbye!\n' to a file named greet.txt, then reads in this fileâ€™s content to verify it is correct. You can delete the greet.txt file after running these instructions program.

Try to write a solution based on the information in this description. If you still have trouble solving this exercise, read the Solution Design and Special Cases and Gotchas sections for additional hints.
